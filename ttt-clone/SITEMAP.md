# Travel to Transform — Site Map & Content Conventions

Reference for anyone (human or Claude) adding or editing pages. Based on the live
site structure as of 2026-07-03. The clone mirrors the live site 1:1.

- **Live site:** https://traveltotransform.com (GoHighLevel funnel, location `pIQnJdASBmjOuDSHEr5v`)
- **Clone:** https://site-six-khaki-48.vercel.app (this repo, Vercel project `site`)
- **Visual index:** https://site-six-khaki-48.vercel.app/clone-map

## URL structure (this is how the LIVE site works, not a migration choice)

Every article — blog post or podcast episode — lives at a single canonical URL:

```
/post/<slug>
```

`/blog/<slug>` and `/podcast/<slug>` do NOT exist and 404 on the live site.
`/blog` and `/podcast` are **listing pages only**: grids of cards that link into
`/post/<slug>`. Whether something is a "blog" or a "podcast" is decided purely by
**which listing page carries its card**, not by its URL.

```
/                       Home
/blog                   Blog listing      → cards link to /post/<slug>
/podcast                Podcast listing   → cards link to /post/<slug>
/book-reviews           Book review listing → cards link to /post/<slug>
/resources              Featured mix: podcast section + blog section + library
/post/<slug>            The article itself (blog AND podcast episodes)
/course/<slug>          Course pages (e.g. /course/tmb)
/about /coaching /speaking /the-book ...   standalone pages
```

## Adding a NEW article (blog or podcast) — playbook

1. Create the page at `traveltotransform.com/post/<slug>.html` in this repo
   (root vercel.json already routes `/post/:slug` → that file).
2. Add its card to the right **listing page**:
   - Blog article → `traveltotransform.com/blog.html`
   - Podcast episode → `traveltotransform.com/podcast.html`
   - Book review → `traveltotransform.com/book-reviews.html`
3. If it should be featured, also add a card to the matching section of
   `traveltotransform.com/resources.html`.
4. Add a row to `/clone-map` (`traveltotransform.com/clone-map.html`).
5. Deploy: `vercel deploy --prod` from the repo/folder root.

An article that exists at `/post/<slug>` but is on NO listing page is an
**orphan**: reachable by direct URL, invisible to visitors and (eventually)
to Google.

NOTE for scrapers/QC: the `/podcast` listing paginates client-side (pages 2–4
load from the GHL API at runtime). Static scraping only sees page 1's six
cards — always click through ALL pagination pages when auditing coverage.

### Podcast episodes (22) — carded on `/podcast` (paginated, 6 per page) + featured on `/resources`

The `/podcast` listing paginates client-side: pages 2–4 are fetched at runtime from
the GHL content API (`content.apisystem.tech`). This works on the clone too (the
clone's pagination calls the same live API). Only page 1 is baked into the HTML.

### Funnel, offer & system pages (28) — from the GHL funnels API

Discovered via `GET services.leadconnectorhq.com/funnels/funnel/list` (16 funnels,
50 steps). These are NOT linked from the main nav; enumerate funnels via the API
when auditing coverage, never by crawling nav links.

### Repo-authored posts

`/post/beyonder-the-podcast-with-veerle-beelen` (Freeman, 2026-07-15) was authored
directly in the repo, not published in GHL — it is carried as a MANUAL_POSTS entry
in tools/publish.py so the /podcast listing shows it. Prefer publishing in GHL
then running sync; ask Freeman to add it in GHL when convenient.

### Correction log

Author Hour (`/post/author-hour-podcast`) was initially flagged as an orphan; it is
actually listed on `/podcast` page 4 (client-side pagination that static scraping
cannot see). All 21 episodes above are listed the same way.

## SEO notes

- The live site's `/sitemap.xml` is an **empty urlset** (GHL emits no URLs).
  This (plus the page sitting on pagination page 4, four clicks deep with no
  static internal link) is the likely cause of the Author Hour ranking drop —
  not the `/post/` slug structure, which is unchanged from the live site.
- The clone intentionally ships **no sitemap.xml and no canonical overrides**;
  it must not compete with the live domain in search.
